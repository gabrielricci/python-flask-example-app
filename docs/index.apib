# LuizaLabs Challenge
This document has the purpose to explain how to set up and run the code challenge proposed by Luiza Labs.

## Differences from the proposed challenge to the presented solution
This challenge seems to be very outdated, and newer versions of the Graph API have deprecated the **username** field, and it's no longer returning the **gender** attribute, so the **username** have been completely removed and the **gender** will be inserted as NULL if the Graph API do not return it.

## Terminology

 - **Facebook ID**: The ID of the user on Facebook.

## Requirements
This document assumes that you already have Python 2.7, Pip, virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper installed. If you do not, please check the following reference:

 - http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

## Clone repository and install requirements

```
# clone the repository
git clone git@bitbucket.org:gabrielricci/luizalabs-challenge.git

# switch to the correct folder
cd luizalabs-challenge

# Setup a new virtualenv
mkvirtualenv luizalabs-challenge

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Running the tests
You can run the test suite without any other configurations, all you have to do is enable your virtualenv and run the following command:

```nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=luizalabs```

**The test suite will use an in-memory sqlite in which it will perform the operations.**


# Group Running the application

## Setting up the database

In order to run the application you gotta setup your database first. This app uses SQLAlchemy as an ORM, it means that you can use the relational database you want, the list of supported databases include:

 - MySQL
 - SQLite
 - PostgreSQL
 - Oracle
 - Microsoft SQL Server

Please check http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/index.html for further information.

The app will get the database connection information from an environment variable called ```DATABASE_URI```, examples of valid values for this environment variable are:

```
# SQLite, where <path> is relative:
export DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///<path>.db"

# SQLite running in memory
export DATABASE_URI="sqlite://"

# MySQL
export DATABASE_URI="mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/foo"
```

**QUICK TIP:** You can easily create a new SQLite database using the following command:
```sqlite3 database.db```

Please check http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls for more examples.


After setting up the environment variable, you need to create the required table struture using the following command:

```
python setup_database.py
```

You should see the following output

```
Deleting tables (if they exist)...
Creating database tables...
You're all set
```

If you got this far, your database is ready to rock.

## Setting up the facebook access token

The Facebook Graph API, which is used by this app, requires an OAuth access token. For more information regarding how to obtain an access token, please read https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/.

After generating a valid access token, you must set it in an environment variable called ```FB_ACCESS_TOKEN```:

```
# Set the FB access token env var
export FB_ACCESS_TOKEN="SomeToken"
```

## Running the app (finally!)

Ok so you finally have your repository cloned, virtualenv installed **and active**, dependencies installed, environment variables all set, now all you gotta do is run the app with the following command:

```
# Run the app
uwsgi -w wsgi:app --socket 0.0.0.0:5555 --protocol http
```

If you forgot any environment variable, an error will be shown at your console. If you also wish you can change 5555 to any other port of your choice.
